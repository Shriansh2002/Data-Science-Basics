# Numpy Functions

Numpy is a Python library for scientific computing. The library provides a range of functions for working with arrays, matrices, and numerical operations.

## Installation
You can install numpy using pip:

```bash
pip install numpy
```

## Functions

Here are some of the main functions provided by numpy:

- `numpy.array`: creates a new numpy array.
- `numpy.zeros`: creates a new numpy array filled with zeros.
- `numpy.ones`: creates a new numpy array filled with ones.
- `numpy.linspace`: creates a new numpy array with evenly spaced values between a start and end point.
- `numpy.arange`: creates a new numpy array with values ranging from a start to end point with a specified step size.
- `numpy.reshape`: reshapes an existing numpy array into a new shape.
- `numpy.concatenate`: concatenates two or more numpy arrays together.
- `numpy.transpose`: transposes a numpy array.
- `numpy.dot`: computes the dot product of two numpy arrays.
- `numpy.sum`: computes the sum of elements in a numpy array.
- `numpy.mean`: computes the mean of elements in a numpy array.
- `numpy.std`: computes the standard deviation of elements in a numpy array.
- `numpy.max`: computes the maximum value in a numpy array.
- `numpy.min`: computes the minimum value in a numpy array.

For more information on these functions and other numpy functionality, please refer to the [numpy documentation](https://numpy.org/doc/1.18/).
